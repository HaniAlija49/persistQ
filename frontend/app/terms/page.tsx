              These Terms of Service ("Terms") are effective as of November 20, 2025. They govern your access to and
              use of PersistQ ("Service"), operated by the account owner ("we", "us", "PersistQ"). By using the Service

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              PersistQ provides a semantic memory storage API and related developer tools and dashboards. The
              Service includes APIs for storing, searching, listing and deleting 'memories', local embedding generation
              using Transformers.js, SDKs and a web dashboard. Exact features, quotas and pricing are described on

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Accounts, API Keys and Security</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              To use core API endpoints you must possess and keep secure an API key. You are responsible for all
              activity that occurs using your API key. If an API key is compromised you must rotate it immediately and
              notify us. We may suspend or revoke keys for abuse or security reasons. We recommend storing keys in a
              secure secrets manager and not committing them to public code repositories.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              You must not use the Service to store, process, or transmit content that: (a) is illegal; (b) infringes
              intellectual property rights; (c) is defamatory, obscene, or harassing; (d) contains targeted PII collected
              without consent; (e) facilitates wrongdoing (e.g., fraud, phishing, malware); or (f) attempts to
              reverse-engineer, overload, or benchmark our systems without consent. You must not bypass rate limits,
              create multiple accounts to circumvent limits, or resell the Service unless you have an express reseller
              agreement.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              You retain all ownership rights in the content ("Memories") you submit to PersistQ. By submitting content
              you grant PersistQ a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to store, process, cache, and otherwise
              use that content solely to provide the Service (including generating embeddings and search indexes). We
              do not claim ownership of your content.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Our Privacy Policy governs how we collect, use, disclose, and retain personal data. We generate
              embeddings locally (Transformers.js) and do not send your content to third-party AI providers. We may
              use third party processors (Neon/PostgreSQL, Upstash, Clerk, Vercel, Render, Highlight.io) to operate the
              Service; their access is limited to performing their functions. You are responsible for ensuring you have the
              right to upload any personal data and for complying with applicable privacy laws (including GDPR and
              CCPA) where you operate.

              Use of paid features requires a subscription or payment method on file. You authorize us to charge the

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Subscriptions continue until canceled. We may suspend or terminate your account immediately for
              violations of these Terms, security incidents, or illegal activity. Upon termination for convenience by you,
              we will retain your data for a limited period (30 days) to allow export. For terminations due to breach, we
              may permanently delete data after notice. Any accrued but unpaid fees survive termination.

              We maintain backups and reasonable data retention policies but do not guarantee against loss. You

              limited period even after account deletion.

              do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. We make commercially

              related to these Terms shall not exceed the total amount paid by you to PersistQ in the 12 months
              preceding the claim, or $100 if you paid nothing. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential,
              special, or punitive damages, including lost profits or lost data.

              We may modify or discontinue features of the Service or update these Terms. We will provide notice of
              material changes via email or dashboard; continued use after notice constitutes acceptance. For major
