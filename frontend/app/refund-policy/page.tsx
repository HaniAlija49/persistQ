            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee from the date of the initial paid purchase for first-time subscribers to paid plans, consistent with the EU Consumer Rights Directive. For EU customers, this serves as your statutory right of withdrawal. To request a refund within this window, contact support@persistq.dev with your account details and reason. If you have actively used the Service during the withdrawal period, you may be asked to acknowledge that you requested immediate performance, but refunds will still be honored within the 14-day window for first-time purchases.

              If you cancel a subscription after the 14-day window, you will retain access until the end of the current
              billing period. Refunds outside the 14-day window are granted at our discretion and may be prorated for
              material billing errors only.
