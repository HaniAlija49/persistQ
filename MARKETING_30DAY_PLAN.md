# PersistQ 30-Day Launch Marketing Plan

Based on comprehensive research of SaaS launch strategies, Product Hunt tactics, and developer marketing best practices for 2025, this plan is tailored specifically for PersistQ's developer audience.

## **Product Overview**

**PersistQ** is an AI-powered semantic memory storage API that enables AI agents and applications to store, retrieve, and search contextual information using vector embeddings.

### **Launch Strategy: Anonymous/Brand-First Approach**

**Why Anonymous**: Due to employment considerations, this launch will be brand-focused rather than founder-focused.

**Brand Identity**:
- All public presence under **"PersistQ"** or **"PersistQ Team"**
- GitHub organization account (not personal)
- Product Hunt submitted by company account
- Community engagement as "@persistq" or team handle
- No personal name attribution in marketing materials

**Benefits of This Approach**:
- ✅ Protects employment situation
- ✅ Company/product focus (common for developer tools)
- ✅ Easier to add team members later
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ❌ Less "founder story" credibility (mitigated by technical depth)

### **Key Differentiators**
- **Zero Embedding Costs**: Uses local Transformers.js instead of paid OpenAI embeddings
- **Privacy-First Design**: Local processing, GDPR compliant, encrypted storage
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple setup, comprehensive documentation, API-first design
- **Multiple Integration Options**: TypeScript SDK, REST API, MCP server for Claude Code/GitHub Copilot
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis caching, sub-200ms response times

### **Target Audience**
- AI/ML Developers building applications with persistent memory needs
- Startup Teams creating AI-powered products (chatbots, assistants, agents)
- Enterprise Developers requiring secure, compliant memory solutions
- Individual Developers using AI tools like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI

## **Anonymous Launch Best Practices**

### **Maintaining Professional Anonymity**

**DO:**
- ✅ Engage as "PersistQ Team" or company handle
- ✅ Use "we" language in communications
- ✅ Focus on product/technical value, not founder story
- ✅ Use privacy-protected domain registration
- ✅ Route all support through team email (support@persistq.com)
- ✅ Keep development work separate from personal accounts

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use personal social media accounts for promotion
- ❌ Accept LinkedIn connections related to PersistQ on personal profile
- ❌ Mention PersistQ in personal bio/about sections
- ❌ Use personal payment methods (Stripe, PayPal) - use business entity
- ❌ Mix personal and business communications

### **Building Credibility Without Personal Brand**

1. **Technical depth = trust**: Detailed technical blog posts establish expertise
2. **Code speaks louder**: Well-documented SDK, comprehensive API docs, code snippets
3. **Responsive community engagement**: Fast responses to support questions
4. **Transparent roadmap**: Public feature requests, honest about limitations
5. **Social proof**: User testimonials, case studies (with permission)
6. **Live demos**: Interactive examples and playgrounds in documentation

### **Tools for Anonymous Operations**

- **Email**: Google Workspace with custom domain (team@persistq.com, support@persistq.com)
- **Domain Privacy**: Use Cloudflare or registrar privacy protection
- **Business Entity**: Consider LLC (adds legitimacy + legal separation)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe connected to business entity, not personal account
- **Social Media**: Buffer/Hootsuite to schedule from team accounts
- **Customer Support**: Intercom/Crisp with team inbox
